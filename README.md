# Amazon Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the data scraped from Amazon product listings. Using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, the project provides insights into product trends, price distributions, and potential sales predictions based on ratings and prices.

## Key Features
- Cleans and preprocesses the scraped Amazon data.
- Visualizes product trends, price distributions, and rating correlations.
- Provides predictions on potential sales based on a simple sales score formula (Rating/Price).
- Offers various types of plots, including scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more complex sales prediction models (e.g., regression analysis) based on additional factors like reviews or product age.
- Expand the analysis to include more product categories and explore different patterns across them.
- Automate the entire pipeline from scraping to analysis for seamless data updates.
